## Problem statement
The current evaluation process for debt collector performance is conducted manually, which presents several critical challenges:

- **Time-consuming and resource-intensive**: The process requires significant manual effort and coordination across multiple stakeholders, leading to inefficiencies and delays in decision-making.
- **Lacks objectivity and consistency**: Evaluations are often influenced by subjective judgment, resulting in inconsistent assessments that may not accurately reflect individual or team performance.
- **Fails to identify key performance drivers**: The manual approach does not systematically capture or analyze the underlying factors that influence collector effectiveness, limiting the organizationâ€™s ability to implement targeted improvements.

## Solution 
To address the limitations of the current manual evaluation process, we propose a data-driven, automated approach that enhances objectivity, speed, and strategic insight:
- **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**  
    Conduct in-depth analysis to uncover distinct performance characteristics among debt collectors. This enables a clearer understanding of individual behavioral traits and facilitates segmentation based on performance profiles.
- **Machine Learning-Based Classification**  
    Develop and deploy machine learning models to automate the classification of debt collectors. This ensures faster, data-driven decision-making and reduces reliance on subjective judgment.
- **Actionable, Measurable Insights**  
    Provide each debt collector with personalized, data-driven insights that highlight the most influential factors affecting their performance. These insights empower targeted improvement and foster continuous development.

## Success Metrics
- Model accuracy > 75% (Accuracy scores that are considered reliable for machine learning)
- Precision, Recall, F1-score > 80% for all classes (Higher because the model is required to perform well in differentiating each performance.)
- Identify important features for individual evaluation
